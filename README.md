# Copy-Selectively
A python script for copying files selectively.

Step 1 start the script
Step 2 choose the folder path
Step 3 choose file extension

The script will create a new folder for the copies, to the same directory where the script is located. You can convert it to an exe, it will work as well, but the restart function will be disabled.
